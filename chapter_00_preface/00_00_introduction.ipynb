The workshop consisted of three parts, an introduction in radio interferometry, an introduction in advanced interferometry, and an introduction in HI analysis techniques including HI specific data reduction. The notebook addresses problems in the context of HI analysis. It is an ongoing project which will be carried on beyond the workshop to provide beginners in radio astronomy with a comprehensive description of HI analysis techniques. At its current stage it implements single contributions, which are loosely linked.

    "Each chapter is contained in a seperate directory, the directory name is formatted like `chapter_ii_name`, where ii is the chapter number and name is the chapter name, with spaces replaced by underscores, e.g. `chapter_6_deconvolution_in_imaging`. The directory will contain notebooks, a `ii_figures` file containing figures (ii being the chapter number),  a ii_bibtex.bib file containing bibtex entries. Any data or additional files will be in a seperate data directory. Notice that very large data should not be stored in a github repository. They should be stored at another place, then the students be instructed to download the data into the data directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook naming should be prefixed with the chapter number (two digits) and a sequential number (two digits) based on ordering in the chapter. Like directories, the notebook name should be the section name (with underscores to replace spaces), a shortened version of the section is also fine, e.g. the Sky Model section of Chapter 6 would be `06_01_sky_models.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notebook Breadth:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each chapter is made up of multiple sections, each of which is possibly made up of sub-section, et cetera. To keep notebooks a reasonable and consumable size, a notebook should only contain a single section. For long sections it may be reasonable to further break up a section into multiple notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notebook Header:\n",
    "\n",
    "The beginning of each notebook should with a set of navigation links including a link to the global outline (this notebook), glossary, the chapter specific introduction notebook, the previous section notebook, and the next section notebook. See example section 1.1.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each chapter should contain a short introduction notebook `ii_00_introduction.py`, which will provide an overview of the topics in the chapter and an outline of the notebooks in the chapter. At the end of the introduction include a list of editors and contributors of the chapter (indicate specific sections).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chapter Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The final notebook of a chapter should contain a section on literature and further reading `ii_references_and_further_reading.ipynb` which contains links to papers and books, it may be useful to write a sentence about why a link is useful. All the external references noted in the chapter should be listed here. Further, the conclusion to a chapter is an appendix `ii_appendix.ipynb`, in which the appendix is put, if required.\n",

    "Citations to published work is a little tricky in our setup, we want to create two links. One for if we convert the notebook to latex we should be able to auto-generate a `\\cite{}` tag, see the nbconvert [citation&#10548;](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert-examples/tree/master/citations) [example&#10548;](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert-examples/blob/master/citations/Tutorial.ipynb). And, the other as a hyperlink to a abstract or copy of the paper (e.g. a NASA ADS link). To do this we need to create a link and use the HTML `<cite data-cite='bibtexRef'>` tag where `bibtexRef` is the name of the reference in the bibtex file in the chapter directory. An up arrow symbol &#10548; (HTML code `&#10548;`) is used to denote an external to the book hyperlink. An example of a complete citation is\n",

    "#### Reference Naming Conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to maintain uniform and informative reference labels we will use a standard naming convention of the form `chapterStr:type:uniqueID` where `chapterStr` is a unqiue, descriptive string for a chapter or chapter subsection, `type` is the type of content beinging labelled, and `uniqueID` is a unique ID for the content. For example a table in and Imaging chapter which contains information on weights could have the label `imaging:tbl:weights`. The `chapterStr` for each chapter is to be defined by the authors. If a section of a chapter is sufficiently large it shoud have its own `chapterStr`, perhaps with the prefix including the chapter `chapterStr`. The following are valid strings for `type`: `tbl` (table), `fig` (figure), `sec` (section), `code` (code block), `eq` (equation). The `uniqueID` is left to the authors, but suggested to contain a simple descriptive string and information on location within the chapter."

If a figure or image is generated by some set of code, please include a reference or notes to that code so that if it needs to be regenerated then that will be possible.
