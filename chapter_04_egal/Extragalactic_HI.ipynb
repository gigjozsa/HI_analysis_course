We begin with an overview of the observed HI morphologies (chapter 4.1) and kinematics (chapter 4.2) of equilibrium disks. We then focus on the relationship between the properties of these resolved disks and star formation therein in chapter 4.3, and how the distortions observed in interacting galaxies are a sensitive tracer of environmental effects. We conclude this chapter with an overview of HI absorption as a tracer of galaxy structure."

    "The dissipative nature of gas and the conservation of angular momentum imposed by gravity imply that gas in undisturbed galaxies is typically distributed in a thin disk whose radial extent well exceeds its vertical one. Examples of the HI surface density distribution in a face-on HI disk is shown in Fig. 4.1 and from an edge-on disk is shown in Fig. 4.2; they illustrate the basic properties of HI disks for Milky Way-like systems. By virtue of the optically thin nature of HI in most parts of a galaxy (ref here), HI maps of galaxies are typically given in units of column density, $N_{HI}$: atoms $cm^{-2}$, or $Mo pc^{-2}$; they are obtained by integrating the HI emission measured along each line-of-sight in the map (see Chapter 9.XXX), and as such are sometimes called *Moment 0* or *total intensity* maps.

    "The maps of Fig. 4.1 illustrate that the HI distributions in disk galaxies typically have central depressions (where the bulk of the disk gas is in the molecular phase; see Hallenbeck et al. 2014 for an extreme example), and extend to larger radii than optical disks. The outer HI surface densities ($N_{HI} = 2 M_o pc^{-2}$) of galaxies follow exponential distributions whose radial scale lengths are 50&#37; larger than those of the optical disk (Bigiel &amp; Blitz 2012; Wang et al. 2014; more here). For example, the and exponential fit to the ensemble of outer HI disk profiles in the sample of Bigiel &amp; Blitz (2012) has a radial scale length of $r_{D,HI} = 0.61r_{25}$, where $r_{25}$ is the radius of the optical disk measured at a (*B*-band) isophotal level of 25 magnitudes per square arcsec."

    "As was first noticed in the late 90s (Broeils &amp; Rhee 1997), there is a tight correlation between the radial extent of HI disks of galaxies and their total HI masses. The relation was confirmed in several studies and recently revisited with a large dataset of Wang et al. (2016; see also Wang et al. 2014, and others here). The relationship between the HI diameter $D_{HI}$ and mass $M_{HI}$ obtained by Wang et al. (2016) is shown in Fig. 4.2, and the best-fitting linear relationship describing the trend is given by: $$log(D_{HI}) = 0.506$$

    "Due to their small distances and hence large angular sizes on the sky, dwarf galaxies in the Local Group are particularly suitable to study the kinematics of the HI gas and the total fraction and spatial distribution of dark matter, although many of the Local Group dwarf galaxies do not show any sign of rotation, but rather appear to be supported by random motions of their gas and stars. Examples include Sagittarius DIG and Pisces&nbsp;I&#8239;/&#8239;LGS&nbsp;3 ([<cite data-cite=\"1997ApJ...490..710Y\">Young &amp; Lo 1997</cite>](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997ApJ...490..710Y)). Several of the Local Group dwarfs with previous HI detections were included in the LITTLE THINGS survey with the VLA ([<cite data-cite=\"2012AJ....144..134H\">Hunter et al. 2012</cite>](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012AJ....144..134H)).

(2015)</cite>](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AJ....149..180O) to derive the rotation curves and mass composition of 26&nbsp;dwarf galaxies across the Local Group and the local volume. They conclude that the relatively shallow inner slopes of the dark-matter density profiles disagree with the generally steeper, cusp-like profiles predicted by dark-matter simulations in the ΛCDM paradigm. The discrepancy can potentially be explained by baryonic feedback processes within the galaxies, such as gas outflows driven by supernovae."
