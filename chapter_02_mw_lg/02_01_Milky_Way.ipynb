    "The interstellar medium (ISM) of the Milky Way galaxy consists at the first sight of dust and gas. \"Dust\" is commonly used as an acronym for massive agglomerations of Carbon and Silicate structures emitting above 100μm as a Black Body (BB) in the far-infrared to radio regime. \"Gas\" comprises a much more complex composition of primarily hydrogen, helium, carbon and some rare heavier elements commonly named \"metals\". Dust and gas are exposed to the radiation from a manifold of different sources. Next to the billions of stars, the extragalactic background objects heat and ionize both dust and gas due to their strong, high energy radiation. Dynamical processes, driven in the simplest case by the Galactic rotation, alter the size spectrum of the dust and heat/cool the dust by strong volume density variations. At first glance, the situation appears to be hopelessly complex, and a straight forward and meaningful description appears to be out of reach. But there is hope. This hope is directly connected to the relevant angular scales and the sensitivity of the performed observations. Thus, considering only large scales (tens of degrees) and a rather low sensitivity threshold provides information on the Galactic ISM as a whole, which appears to be well ordered and describable by simple equations. This is our starting point here."

At that location at the sky, it is pretty obvious that the clouds will eventually collide with the Milky Way disk. Depending on their radial velocities these clouds have been classified as high (HVC, $|v_\\rm{ LSR}| \\geq 100\\,\\rm{km}\\,\\rm{s}^{-1}$) and intermediate  (IVC, $100\\,\\rm{km} \\, \\rm{s}^{-1} \\geq |v_\\rm{LSR}| \\geq 20\\, \\rm{km} \\, \\rm{s}^{-1}$) velocity clouds. \"Local clouds\" are often called low-velocity clouds (LVC) distributed in radial velocity evenly around $v_\\rm{LSR} = 0 \\, \\rm{km} \\,\\rm{s}^{-1}$. In radio astronomy we only measure the line of sight component of the complete velocity vector. Consequently, a HVC moving almost tangetially to the line of sight is wrongly identified as a LVC (see Chapter on the Milky Way and the Local Group, [LINK HERE] here, the Magellanic Stream crossing the southern polar cap). A more physical definition, i.e. via the dust-to-gas ratio, is more adequate. All velocities are evaluated within a specific rest frame. Commonly we use the *Local Standard of Rest* (LSR) which is a system defined by the stellar motion in the immediate vicinity of the Sun. Because of the definition of the LSR system by the local stars at rest, the Sun has a low residual motion in this rest frame.

The velocity dispersion of a gaseous phase depends on the physical state of its atoms. If the gas is partly ionized, magnetic fields adds a pressure component to the gaseous one, increasing consequently the scale height. Supernovae inject cosmic-rays into the ISM. Their path through the interstellar medium is limited by the strength and spatial structure of the magnetic fields, thus adding a third component to the pressue.

    "<b>Missing Spacing an Issue or Scienctific Limitation?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The future of radio astronomy is in interferometry. Because the sensitivity increases with the collecting area of an instrument, the astrophysical impact of single dish radio telescope is severely limited. Even the largest fully steerable radio dishes of 100-m size offer at 21-cm about 10 arcmin angular resolution. A huge advantage of radio waves in comparison to optical and near infrared astronomy, is that the waves reach the observer as <i>coherent</i> wave trains. Thus one needs to equip individual radio telescopes with receivers sampling the wave train accurately and recording it onto a hard disk. Using this procedure it is feasible to calculate the interference pattern between telescopes (<i>fringes</i>), sampling the same wave front but separated by hundreds or even many thousands of kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows to even resolve AU scales at Mpc distances. However, their is a severe physical limitation. This limitation is directly connected to the WNM/CNM discussion above. CNM is structures typically on small angular scales while the WNM on large angular scales. Large angular scales denote ten to a few hundred arcmin. By construction, the largest angular scale a radio interferometer samples is determined by the minimal separation between two neighbouring radio dishes. This implies that an interferometric observation provides arcsec to arcmin angular resolution but all emission of the source larger in extent are not recorded, because the receiving aperature has no collecting area at these scales. Typically WNM structures of diffuse HI emission associated with a galactic halo are distributed on angular scales that are untraceable for a radio interferometer. This \"missing spacings\" issue is well understood in radio astronomy but mostly considered as a severe problem for the Milky Way astronomers and not for extragalactic exploration. But calculate for yourself HI gas with a scale height of the Milky Way halo with 4.4 kpc at a distance of 1 Mpc. You will immediately recognize that this is a potential issue for all HI observations in the Local Group of Galaxies and the neigbouring groups like M81/M82 or the Sculptor group.\n",

The 100-m dish traces mainly the extended HI gas belonging to the WNM. The peak brightness temperature is an order of magnitude below that of Westerbork.

Moreover, consistent with this ram pressure scenario, the leading cold head reveals the highest radial velocity while the gas in the tail is trailing beyond the head. Ram pressure interactions might cause instabilities, triggering the instable gas to form cold and dense structures and acting as an additional gas pressurre component. This comprehensive scenario is not deducible from the radio interferometric observations alone. One needs to complement the WSRT with single dish data for a comprehensive picture ([<cite data-cite=\"2014A&A...563A..99F\">Faridani et al.
